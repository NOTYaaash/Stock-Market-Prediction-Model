This repository contains Python code that implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for predicting stock prices. The model is trained on historical closing prices of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) stock data downloaded from Yahoo Finance.

Key Features:

- Utilizes LSTM architecture for capturing sequential dependencies in time series data.
- Performs data preprocessing, including scaling and windowing.
- Employs Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss function during training.
- Saves the trained model as `Stock Prediction Model.keras` for future use.

Dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `pandas_datareader`
- `yfinance`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras` 

Instructions:

1. Install Required Libraries:
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed in your Python environment. You can typically install them using `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pandas_datareader yfinance tensorflow keras`.

2. Run the Script:
   Execute the Python script (`main.py` or the script containing the code) to download the data, train the model, and visualize the predicted vs. actual closing prices.

Output:

The script will generate a plot comparing the predicted closing prices with the actual closing prices of the test data.

Further Exploration:

- Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., number of LSTM units, learning rate) to potentially improve the model's performance.
- Consider adding support for predicting multiple stocks or additional financial data features.
- Explore more advanced forecasting techniques beyond LSTMs.

This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world financial trading decisions. Stock prices are inherently volatile, and past performance is no guarantee of future results.
